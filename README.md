Java Stream and Lambda Expressions Project
üìå Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Lambda Expressions and Java Stream API for performing sorting, filtering, and aggregation operations on different data types ‚Äî Employees, Students, and Products.

üß© Part (a): Sorting Employee Objects Using Lambda Expressions
Description

Demonstrates how to sort a list of Employee objects using Lambda expressions.

Sorting is done based on:

Salary (ascending order)

Name (alphabetical order)

Key Concepts

List.sort((e1, e2) -> ...)

Comparator using Lambda

forEach(System.out::println) for printing

Sample Output
Sorted by Salary:
103 - Rohit - 40000.0
101 - Ayush - 50000.0
102 - Karan - 60000.0

Sorted by Name:
101 - Ayush - 50000.0
102 - Karan - 60000.0
103 - Rohit - 40000.0

üéì Part (b): Filtering and Sorting Students Using Streams
Description

Uses Java Streams to filter and sort student records.

Displays students with marks greater than 70, sorted in descending order.

Key Concepts

.filter() ‚Äì filters elements based on condition

.sorted() ‚Äì sorts stream elements using Lambda

.forEach() ‚Äì terminal operation to print data

Sample Output
Students with marks > 70 (Sorted by marks descending):
Riya - 92
Ayush - 85
Simran - 75

üõí Part (c): Stream Operations on Product Dataset
Description

Performs multiple stream operations on a product list:

Filtering products with price > 1000

Calculating average price

Finding the most expensive product

Key Concepts

.filter() for conditional selection

.mapToDouble() for numeric mapping

.average() and .max() for aggregation

Sample Output
Products priced above 1000:
1 - Laptop - 60000.0
3 - Keyboard - 1500.0
4 - Monitor - 12000.0

Average Price: 18550.0
Most Expensive Product: 1 - Laptop - 60000.0
